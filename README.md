# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Portfolio-Project
# üçï Pizza Sales Dashboard ‚Äì SQL & Excel Project

This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL and visualizes key business metrics in an Excel dashboard. It covers various KPIs, order trends, category performance, and best/worst sellers.
##  Project Execution Flow

1. **SQL Query Execution (SQL Server):**
   - All KPIs and trend insights were generated using SQL queries on Microsoft SQL Server.
   - The results were captured using screenshots and exported as tables.

2. **Export and Dashboard Building (Excel):**
   - Cleaned and structured results were uploaded to Excel.
   - Used pivot charts, graphs, slicers, and formatting to create an interactive dashboard.
   - Final visuals were verified against original SQL query outputs for accuracy.

##  Project Workflow

The analysis is structured in four key phases:
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Removed NULLs and duplicates  
   - Ensured correct data types (e.g., converting text to datetime)

2. **Data Pre-processing**  
   - Standardized date and time formats  
   - Created new columns (e.g., extracting hour, day of week)  
   - Formatted numbers for accurate calculations

3. **Data Analysis with SQL**  
   - Performed descriptive analysis using aggregation queries  
   - Derived KPIs like revenue, orders, sales by category/size  
   - Identified best/worst selling pizzas

4. **Data Visualization (Excel Dashboard)**  
   - Built an interactive dashboard showing trends and patterns  
   - Used charts, slicers, and KPIs for executive-level presentation
